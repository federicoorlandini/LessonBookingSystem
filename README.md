# LESSON BOOKING SYSTEM

## Why did I start this project?
I started this project to dirt my hands with these technologies:

* Event modelling (see https://eventmodeling.org/)
* Event sourcing
* Java SpringBoot
* PostgreSQL for event sourcing (see https://github.com/eugene-khyst/postgresql-event-sourcing)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a simple software that can help in managing presences for lessons.
This system must allow the users to:

* define a list of available lessons
* book a spot in a lesson
